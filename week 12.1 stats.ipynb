    "\n",
    "The primary difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in their applications, particularly regarding the sample size and population variance. Here's a detailed comparison and example scenarios for each test:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **t-Test vs. z-Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumptions and Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **t-Test**:\n",
    "     - Used when the sample size is small (typically \\( n < 30 \\)).\n",
    "     - Population variance is unknown.\n",
    "     - Assumes the sample data is drawn from a normally distributed population.\n",
    "   - **z-Test**:\n",
    "     - Used when the sample size is large (typically \\( n \\geq 30 \\)).\n",
    "     - Population variance is known.\n",
    "     - Can be used even if the population is not normally distributed, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distribution**:\n",
    "   - **t-Test**:\n",
    "     - Uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal distribution. This accounts for additional variability due to smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "   - **z-Test**:\n",
    "     - Uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **t-Test Example**:\n",
    "   - **Scenario**: A researcher wants to determine if a new drug has a different effect on blood pressure compared to a placebo. The researcher conducts a study with 20 participants and measures their blood pressure changes.\n",
    "   - **Application**: Since the sample size is small (20 participants), and the population variance of blood pressure changes is unknown, the researcher would use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **z-Test Example**:\n",
    "   - **Scenario**: A manufacturer claims that the average lifetime of their light bulbs is 1,000 hours. A quality control analyst tests this claim by sampling 100 light bulbs and finds that the sample mean lifetime is 990 hours, knowing the population standard deviation is 50 hours.\n",

    "### **Key Differences**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direction of Hypothesis**:\n",

    "2. **Critical Region**:\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed**: The critical region is entirely in one tail of the distribution.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed**: The critical region is split between both tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **P-Value Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed**: The p-value represents the probability of observing the test statistic in the specified direction.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed**: The p-value represents the probability of observing the test statistic in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Making**:\n",
    "   - **One-Tailed**: More power to detect an effect in one direction but cannot detect an effect in the opposite direction.\n",
    "   - **Two-Tailed**: Less power to detect an effect in one direction but can detect an effect in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Choosing Between One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-Tailed**: Use when you have a specific directional hypothesis (e.g., better or worse, higher or lower).\n",
    "- **Two-Tailed**: Use when you have a non-directional hypothesis and are interested in any significant difference, regardless of direction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Margin of Error in a Confidence Interval**\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error in a confidence interval quantifies the uncertainty or variability of the sample estimate. It represents the maximum expected difference between the true population parameter and the sample estimate, given a specified level of confidence. The margin of error is influenced by the standard deviation of the sample, the sample size, and the desired confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula for Margin of Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error (\\(ME\\)) for a confidence interval can be calculated using the following formula for a population mean when the population standard deviation is known:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ME = z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, the formula using the t-distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ME = t \\left( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.\n",
    "- \\( t \\) is the t-score from the t-distribution table corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom.\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) is the population standard deviation.\n",
    "- \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effect of Sample Size on Margin of Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size (\\( n \\)) has an inverse relationship with the margin of error. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This is because a larger sample size reduces the standard error (\\( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) or \\( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\)), which in turn reduces the margin of error. This relationship can be understood from the formula itself, where the standard error decreases as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario: Estimating Average Heights of Students**\n",

    "Suppose a researcher is estimating the average height of students in a university. Initially, they collect a sample of 30 students and find a mean height of 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. They calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Initial Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size (n)**: 30\n",
    "2. **Sample Mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\))**: 170 cm\n",
    "3. **Sample Standard Deviation (s)**: 10 cm\n",
    "4. **Confidence Level**: 95%\n",
    "5. **t-Score for 95% Confidence and 29 Degrees of Freedom**: Approximately 2.045\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ME = t \\left( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 2.045 \\left( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{30}} \\right) \\approx 2.045 \\left( \\frac{10}{5.477} \\right) \\approx 3.735 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the margin of error is approximately 3.735 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Increasing Sample Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose the researcher decides to increase the sample size to 100 students to get a more precise estimate.\n",

    "1. **New Sample Size (n)**: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ME = t \\left( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 1.984 \\left( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{100}} \\right) = 1.984 \\left( \\frac{10}{10} \\right) = 1.984 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the new margin of error is approximately 1.984 cm.\n",

    "\n",
    "By increasing the sample size from 30 to 100, the margin of error decreases from 3.735 cm to 1.984 cm. This illustrates how a larger sample size results in a smaller margin of error, leading to a more precise estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error in a confidence interval measures the uncertainty around the sample estimate. Increasing the sample size reduces the margin of error because it decreases the standard error. This relationship highlights the importance of a larger sample size in achieving more precise and reliable estimates in statistical analysis."

    "\n",
    "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean given the sample information, we'll use the following formula:\n",

    "\\[ \\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n",

    "### Given Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population mean (\\( \\mu \\)): 60\n",
    "- Population standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)): 8\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n \\)): 50\n",
    "- Sample mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\)): 65\n",
    "- Confidence level: 90%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find the z-score for 90% confidence level**:\n",
    "   - For a 90% confidence level, \\( \\alpha = 0.10 \\) (two-tailed test), so \\( \\alpha/2 = 0.05 \\).\n",
    "   - From the standard normal distribution table or calculator, \\( z_{0.05} \\approx 1.645 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the margin of error**:\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.645 \\left( \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{50}} \\right) \\]\n",

    "   \\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.645 \\times 1.131 \\]\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Margin of Error} \\approx 1.863 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Construct the confidence interval**:\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm \\text{Margin of Error} \\]\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{CI} = 65 \\pm 1.863 \\]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are 90% confident that the true population mean lies between 63.137 and 66.863. This means that if we were to repeat this sampling procedure many times and construct a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 90% of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population mean based on the sample data. In this case, with a sample size of 50 and a sample mean of 65, the 90% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (63.137, 66.863). This interval gives us an idea of the precision of our estimate and the variability that may exist in the population mean."

    "  \\[\n",

    "The significance level (\\( \\alpha \\)) is 0.10 (10% or 90% confidence level).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-sample t-test, the test statistic is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\]\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean reaction time.\n",

    "\\[ t = \\frac{0.01}{0.0091} \\]\n",
    "\\[ t \\approx 1.099 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Determine the Critical Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a two-tailed test and the significance level (\\( \\alpha \\)) is 0.10, \\( \\alpha/2 = 0.05 \\). From the t-distribution table or calculator, the critical values for a two-tailed test with \\( df = 29 \\) (degrees of freedom) and \\( \\alpha/2 = 0.05 \\) are approximately \\( \\pm 1.699 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Make the Decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the calculated t-value with the critical t-value:\n",
    "- If \\( |t| \\) is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\).\n",

    "\\[ 1.099 < 1.699 \\]\n",

    "### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the absolute value of the calculated t-value (1.099) is less than the critical value (1.699), we fail to reject the null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) at the 90% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not enough evidence at the 10% significance level to conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time based on the sample data. The observed mean reaction time of 0.25 seconds could reasonably occur due to random sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-sample t-test allows us to compare the sample mean to a hypothesized population mean and determine if they are significantly different from each other. In this case, with a significance level of 0.10, we did not find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that caffeine does not have a significant effect on reaction time based on the provided sample data."
